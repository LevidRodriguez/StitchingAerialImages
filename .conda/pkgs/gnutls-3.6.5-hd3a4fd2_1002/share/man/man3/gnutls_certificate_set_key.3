.SH NAME
gnutls_certificate_set_key \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/abstract.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_certificate_set_key(gnutls_certificate_credentials_t " res ", const char ** " names ", int " names_size ", gnutls_pcert_st * " pcert_list ", int " pcert_list_size ", gnutls_privkey_t " key ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_certificate_credentials_t res" 12
is a \fBgnutls_certificate_credentials_t\fP type.
.IP "const char ** names" 12
is an array of DNS name of the certificate (NULL if none)
.IP "int names_size" 12
holds the size of the names list
.IP "gnutls_pcert_st * pcert_list" 12
contains a certificate list (path) for the specified private key
.IP "int pcert_list_size" 12
holds the size of the certificate list
.IP "gnutls_privkey_t key" 12
is a \fBgnutls_privkey_t\fP key
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function sets a certificate/private key pair in the
gnutls_certificate_credentials_t type.  This function may be
called more than once, in case multiple keys/certificates exist for
the server.  For clients that want to send more than their own end\-
entity certificate (e.g., also an intermediate CA cert), the full
certificate chain must be provided in  \fIpcert_list\fP .

Note that the  \fIkey\fP and the elements of  \fIpcert_list\fP will become part of the credentials
structure and must not be deallocated. They will be automatically deallocated
when the  \fIres\fP structure is deinitialized.

If that function fails to load the  \fIres\fP structure is at an undefined state, it must
not be reused to load other keys or certificates.

Note that, this function by default returns zero on success and a negative value on error.
Since 3.5.6, when the flag \fBGNUTLS_CERTIFICATE_API_V2\fP is set using \fBgnutls_certificate_set_flags()\fP
it returns an index (greater or equal to zero). That index can be used to other functions to refer to the added key\-pair.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success this functions returns zero, and otherwise a negative value on error (see above for modifying that behavior).
